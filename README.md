# Visualization_Project
Project 3 - Bill Malley, Claude David, Halle Morel, Liz Emley, Alicia Bonds

In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an interactive web based dashboard (https://claudedavid.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/22266ea598c24a7babfbf278d244659b) to visualize and track reported cases in real-time. The dashboard illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries for all affected countries. The raw data is collected from multiple sources but we mainly gathered the aggregated data from John Hopkins Univerity’s GitHub: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.
